backup-manager (0.7.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This upstream release changes where the MD5 checksums are stored. As a
    result, the first few post-upgrade backup runs will not find the
    checksums from older backups, and a warning will result. This will
    self-resolve as the older backups expire.

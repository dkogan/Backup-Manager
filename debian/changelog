backup-manager (0.7.10.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Sven Joachim ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Adds a new "postgresql" backup method (Closes: #637743).

    the upstream po files before the build and restore them in the clean
    target (Closes: #602633).
  * Drop the debian-perl-location.diff patch, setting PERL5DIR in
    debian/rules instead.
  * Refresh the remaining Debian patches.
  * Fill out the same "Language:" header in debian/po/*.po.
  * Drop findutils dependency, even the version in Etch is new enough.
  * Explicitly state source format 1.0 in debian/source/format.
  * Upgrade Standards-Version to 3.9.2, no changes needed.
  * Update lintian override for Lintian 2.5.

  * Add build-indep and (empty) build-arch targets to debian/rules.
  * Update Vcs-* fields in debian/control, switching to collab-maint.

  [ Georgios M. Zarkadas ]
  * Add Greek debconf translation.
  * Allow absolute paths in BM_TARBALL_BLACKLIST even when backing up
    the root (/) directory (Closes: #608237).
  * Fix missed archive uploads when backups are crossing the day
    limit (Closes: # 638803).
  * Use a single MD5 sums file to store archive hashes instead of one
    such file per backup job (Closes: #638919).
  * Provide a configuration option to record all uploaded archives in
    a single text database file (Closes: #638920).

backup-manager (0.7.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

    Support for this filetype had been introduced in 0.7.5, but could

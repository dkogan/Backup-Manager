  [ Sven Joachim ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #655985).
    - Adds a new "postgresql" backup method (Closes: #637743).

    since perl is required by backup-manager-purge (LP: #941919).

    debian/rules instead.
  * Refresh the remaining Debian patches.

  * Demote the priority of the repo_user/repo_group debconf templates to
    medium.
  * Update debian/copyright.

  [ Georgios M. Zarkadas ]

  * Provide a configuration option to record all uploaded archives in

    file handling.
  * Add support for local unix sockets connections to the pgsql backup method.

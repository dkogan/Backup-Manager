Description: command-line backup tool
 This is a backup program, designed to help you make daily archives of
 your file system.
 .
 Written in bash and perl, it can make tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, and zip
 archives and can be run in a parallel mode with different
 configuration files. Other archives are possible: MySQL or SVN dumps,
 incremental backups...
 .
 Archives are kept for a given number of days and the upload system
 can use FTP, SSH or RSYNC to transfer the generated archives to a list of
 remote hosts.
 .
 Automatically burning archives to removable media such as CD or DVD is also
 possible.
 .
 The configuration file is very simple and basic and gettext is used for
 internationalization.

For Apple OSX with Fink:
------------------------

1) Install Fink.

2) Download Backup-Manager:

  Olga:~ user$ curl -L https://github.com/sukria/Backup-Manager/zipball/v0.7.10 > ~/Desktop/Backup-manager-0.7.10.zip
  Olga:~ user$ cd ~/Desktop
  Olga:Desktop user$ unzip backup-manager-0.7.10.zip
  Olga:Desktop user$ cd sukria-Backup-Manager-bc8f744

3) Then "make install", and install the needed packages asked by Fink,
as all the needed packages are not installed with the basic Fink install.

  Olga:sukria-Backup-Manager-bc8f744 user$ make install -e FINK=/sw

4) After complete install, copy, edit the "backup-manager.conf" file:

  Olga:sukria-Backup-Manager-bc8f744 user$ cp /usr/share/backup-manager/backup-manager.conf.tpl /etc/backup-manager.conf
  Olga:sukria-Backup-Manager-bc8f744 user$ vim /etc/backup-manager.conf

5) Then you can start Backup-Manager with:

  Olga:~ user$ env PATH=/sw/lib/coreutils/bin:$PATH backup-manager -v

6) Backup-Manager is now installed in:

  /usr/share/backup-manager
